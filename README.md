# Excel-Bill-Validation-Tool

Sample â€“ Billing Validation (BV)

This project is a comprehensive billing validation system built in Excel for analyzing and verifying electricity and gas utility invoices. It cross-checks supplier invoices against contractual rates and metered consumption to detect overcharges, undercharges, and validation errors.

The system automates validation for different types of energy meters (Half-Hourly HH, Non-Half-Hourly NHH, and Gas) and consolidates the results into a clear dashboard and summary.
